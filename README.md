## 💡 Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build your project for production.

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
(You can replace npm with yarn, pnpm, or bun depending on your package manager.)

The server will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

bash

npm run build

Once the build process completes, your application will be ready for deployment.
API Integration

The frontend interacts with the backend File Management System via API for performing file-related operations. Below are the available API endpoints used:

    Upload File: POST /api/files/upload
    Download File: GET /api/files/:id/download
    List Files: GET /api/files
    Search Files: GET /api/files/search?q=query

Ensure the backend is running for proper functionality.
