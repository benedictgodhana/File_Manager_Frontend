## 💡 Usage

This section details how to start your file management system and build it for production.

### Starting the Development Server

Run the following command to start the development server. The app will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
npm run dev
```

(Repeat for yarn, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

> Use `NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings'` to suppress import warnings. If you're on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, change it to `NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'`. You can also omit this if you don’t mind the warnings.

### Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

(Repeat for yarn, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

After the build process, your file manager system will be ready for deployment in a production environment.
